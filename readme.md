OpenBSD Router

This is a bunch of config files for configuring OpenBSD provide DHCP, DNS, Firewalling and other services

This is hacked together from bits and bobs all over the Internet

Nobody should use this

Hardware is an APU2c4 https://www.pcengines.ch/apu2c4.htm

My ISP is Internode (Australia). I have ADSL2+ using a Cisco 887 and/or Billion 7800NXL in Bridge mode

I have 1 (one) static IPv4 IP and a static /64 for IPv6

Some cool scripts and configs I used:
